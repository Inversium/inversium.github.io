			description: "Players assume control of Ori, a white guardian spirit. To progress in the game, players are tasked to move between platforms and solve puzzles. The game world unfolds to the player in the form of a Metroidvania, with new movement abilities allowing the player to access previously inaccessible areas. Unlike The Blind Forest, however, Will of the Wisps relies on autosaving rather than manually placed soul links, and the sequential upgrade system of the first title has been abandoned for a shard system more akin to charms in Hollow Knight. Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the Rayman and Metroid franchises.",
